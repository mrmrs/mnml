# MNML

## What is this?

View the project page at [http://mn-ml.cc](http://mn-ml.cc "MNML - A light-weight responsive html5 boilerplate.")

MNML is a starting point for prototyping responsive HTML5 SASS projects.
Uses gulp to create a dev environment for rapidly prototyping sites.

## Features

* sass compilation
* css minification
* css linting
* autoprefixer (automatically adds appropriate vendor prefixes)
* browser reload on filesave
* local server for serving a static site

## Getting started

Watch [this screencast](https://vimeo.com/121332805) on getting mnml setup or
follow the directions below.

### Instructions

* Create a new repo for your project on Github
* In terminal run each line as a separate command
```bash
    git clone git@github.com:mrmrs/mnml.git yourNewRepoName
    cd yourNewRepoName
    rm -rf .git
    git init
    git remote add origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git
```

* git remote -v will allow you to check that you have changed the remote origin correctly. The output should look like:
```bash
    origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git (fetch)
    origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git (push)
```

## Dev environment
To set up a convenient dev environment run this at the root of mnml

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

Gulp is a javascript task runner. It compiles sass, lints the compiled css, and
sets up a browser-sync server so you can save your fingers from pressing ⌘+TAB + ⌘+r
every time you save a file.

* Once you add & commit files you are ready to publish run:
```bash
git push origin master
```
