## What is this?

View the project page at [http://mn-ml.cc](http://mn-ml.cc "MNML - A light-weight responsive html5 boilerplate.")

Uses browser-sync to create a livereloading server for rapidly prototyping sites.

## Features

* Css minification
* Autoprefixer (automatically adds appropriate vendor prefixes)
* Browser reload on filesave using browser-sync
* Local server for serving a static site
* Uses normalize.css

## Getting started

### Instructions

* Clone the repo from GitHub and make it your own.
* In terminal run each line as a separate command

```https
    git clone https://github.com/mrmrs/mnml.git yourNewRepoName
```

```ssh
    git clone git@github.com:mrmrs/mnml.git yourNewRepoName
```

Then

```bash
    cd yourNewRepoName
    rm -rf .git
    git init
    git remote add origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git
```

* git remote -v will allow you to check that you have changed the remote origin correctly. The output should look like:
```bash
    origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git (fetch)
    origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git (push)
```

## Dev environment

```
