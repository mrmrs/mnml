* autoprefixer (automatically adds appropriate vendor prefixes)
* browser reload on filesave using browser-sync
* local server for serving a static site

## Getting started

### Instructions

* Create a new repo for your project on Github
* In terminal run each line as a separate command
```bash
    git clone git@github.com:mrmrs/mnml.git yourNewRepoName
    cd yourNewRepoName
    rm -rf .git
    git init
    git remote add origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git
```

* git remote -v will allow you to check that you have changed the remote origin correctly. The output should look like:
```bash
    origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git (fetch)
    origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git (push)
```

* Install development packages
```bash
	npm install
```

## Dev environment

```bash
	npm start
```
